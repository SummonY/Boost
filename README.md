# Boost
Boost is a set of libraries for the C++ programming language that provide support for tasks and   structures such as linear algebra, pseudorandom number generation, multithreading, image processing,   regular expressions, and unit testing. It contains over eighty individual libraries.

Most of the Boost libraries are licensed under the Boost Software License, designed to allow Boost   to be used with both free and proprietary software projects.   Many of Boost's founders are on the C++ standards committee, and several Boost libraries have been accepted for incorporation into both Technical Report 1 and the C++11 standard.
